"""
RequestMemory port — tracks requests, drafts, and owner reviews.

Every message the system wants to send (acknowledgment, cleaner query,
guest reply) is saved as a draft first.  The owner reviews it, marks it
OK or NOK, optionally writes what they actually sent, and leaves a comment.
Over time the NOK entries become training data for improving prompts.
